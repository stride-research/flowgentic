# Fault Tolerance

Keep agents resilient with retries, timeouts, and failure isolation.

- Configurable retry/backoff policies
- Fault boundaries between nodes
- Clear logging and error propagation

## Concepts

- Retry policy: attempts, backoff, jitter
- Boundary: isolates node failures from cascading
